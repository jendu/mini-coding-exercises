# mini-coding-exercises
A medley of mini exercises I've done in response to many tasks available online (e.g. HackerRank, Edabit, LeetCode etc).

+ CountAlphanumericOccurrences - compares against fixed arrays
+ CountAlphanumericOccurrencesHashMap - uses HashMap
+ LargestBinaryGap - counts largest number of consecutive 0s in binary representation of an integer
